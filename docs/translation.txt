To setup translations, you need to create file in the
following directory named com.rpgwnn.mo

lib/LocaleData/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/

where $LANG is the locale code such as en, en_GB, or en_GB.UTF-8
The locale code can be as generic or specific as you like.

For example, lib/LocaleData/en_GB.UTF-8/LC_MESSAGES/com.rpgwnn.mo

You may also wish to create the corresponding .po file in the same
location to assist in managing the translations. The .po file is 
"plain" text whereas the .mo is the binary form.

You can use Poedit to edit the files - http://www.poedit.net/

Alternatively, the Linux commands msgfmt and msgunfmt can be used
to convert .po to .mo and vice versa. These are included with 
installations of gettext usually (but not on OSX 10.7!)
