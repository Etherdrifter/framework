To run any of the tests in the 't' directory, use:

$ prove -l t/001_base.t

This should run all the tests in that file and display something like:

t/001_base.t .. ok   
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.01 sys +  0.22 cusr  0.02 csys =  0.28 CPU)
Result: PASS

To run all tests, omit the filename parameter and it will run t/*.t

$ prove -l

t/001_base.t ................ ok   
t/002_index_route.t ......... ok   
t/003_db_accounts.t ......... ok   
t/004_character_location.t .. ok   
All tests successful.
Files=4, Tests=8,  2 wallclock secs ( 0.04 usr  0.02 sys +  1.85 cusr  0.20 csys =  2.11 CPU)
