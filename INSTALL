Installing the RPGWNN framework and prerequisites
=================================================

Pre-requisites
==============

RPGWNN requires a few Perl modules to be installed in addition to
the core modules that come with any modern Perl installation.

We've tried to keep it to a minimum by using the Dancer micro 
web application framework which itself has very few requirements.

PSGI is an interface between Perl web applications and web servers,
and Plack is a Perl module and toolkit that contains PSGI middleware,
helpers and adapters to web servers.

Information about Dancer can be found at http://perldancer.org/

Information about Plack can be found at http://plackperl.org/


Automatic installation of prerequisites
---------------------------------------

The "quick" method is to install the RPGWNN Bundle found in this
distribution. The only downside is that it may unneccessarily 
upgrade modules that you may already have installed on your system.

  cd lib && perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::RPGWNN'

Manual installation
-------------------

If you don't want to do the automated method, you can install the key
modules manually. Specifically, these modules are

    Dancer
    Plack
    Template   (Template Toolkit)
    YAML::Any  (replacement for YAML)

Installation of these modules and their dependencies can be done
(assuming you have CPAN installed) using the following command.

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Plack; install Dancer;
    install Template; install YAML::Any;'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database
========

As a MySQL administrator account, you need to create a database and grant
permissions to the user.

By default, we use the database name "rpg_db", with a username of
"rpg_user" and password of "rpg_pass"
If you wish to change these defaults (and you should probably change
at least the password) simply replace them in the instructions below.

 CREATE DATABASE rpg_db;
 GRANT ALL ON rpg_db.* TO 'rpg_user'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED BY 'rpg_pass';

If all is well, you should be able to run the following command at
a shell prompt and connect to the database.

 mysql -urpg_user -prpg_pass rpg_db

Next, import the database schema (schema.sql) to create the table
structure.

 mysql -urpg_user -prpg_pass rpg_db < schema.sql

If you change the database details, also ensure that config.yml is
updated with the new information.
